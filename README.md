# Line-Cleaner
Checks if a line starts with a number , if it does removes it!

I noticed my professor in collage has a problem when he trys to copy some code from a pdf book to an online compiler which causes a problem which is that the book has each line numbered in ascending order so professor has to remove them manually one by one which wastes some time.

So I made a web app that takes the code and checks if each line starts with a number and if it does it'll remove it so the code can be directely copied ,pasted and used and I thought to myself what not upload it to github so I can access it at anytime.
